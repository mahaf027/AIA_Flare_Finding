# URS
Code, and results for Theo Mahaffey's AIA flare finding URS Project.
helpers.py and download.py define methods used throughout the process. classes.py defines the
classes employed in my object-oriented approach to describing and analyzing time series of images.
workspace.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook where one can create Instant and Interval objects and perform
operations on them as defined in the .py files. All important data and results are saved to the
./DATA/ subdirectory specific to the date of the Interval being analyzed.

Project dates: 9/26/2022 - 12/15/2022
